** Installation
You have to install [[https://add0n.com/stylus.html][Stylus]] and then click on the install link below.

[[https://gitlab.com/vednoc/dark-instagram/raw/master/instagram.user.styl][https://img.shields.io/badge/Install%20directly%20with-Stylus-116b59.svg?longCache=true&style=flat]]

*** Initial configuration
To customize colors and/or other features, follow these instructions:
  - Open the Stylus extension popup while you're on any page Dark-Instagram is
    active on, or from the Manage page in Stylus. Click on the cogwheel icon and
    that'll open up a menu from which you can customize the available options.
  - Additionally, install [[https://gitlab.com/vednoc/dark-switcher/][dark-switcher]] if you'd like to quickly switch between
    various pre-defined color-schemes.

*** Other ways to install this userstyle
Supported but /not recommended/.

**** Userstyle managers that don't support stylus-lang but support UserCSS
Just install from =instagram.user.css= file using [[https://gitlab.com/vednoc/dark-instagram/raw/master/instagram.user.css][this link]].

**** /Stylish/ is only supported through /[[https://userstyles.org/styles/151951][userstyles.org]]/
USo is still the largest repository for themes despite all the issues. Don't use
this version unless you /absolutely/ have to.

It only has core functionality, is (likely) outdated, has no support, and needs
to be /manually/ compiled for every single update.

** Contributions
Any contribution is greatly appreciated.
